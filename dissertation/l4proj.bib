abstract = {In the last years big social networks like Facebook or Twitter admit that on their networks are fake and duplicate accounts, fake news and fake likes. With these accounts, their creators can distribute false information, support or attack an idea, a product, or an election candidate, influencing real network users in making a decision. In this paper, we present our system build with the aim of identifying fake users and fake news in the Twitter social network.}
